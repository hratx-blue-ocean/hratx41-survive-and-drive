## Introduction

UpLift was a brief 1-week sprint where our team built an MVP for an external user, David Guenther (https://github.com/DcguentherATX).  Our vision is to simplify transportation for people currently battling cancer.  You focus on getting well.  We'll take care of getting you to your appointments.

## What does the app do? 

    * UpLift connects cancer patients with volunteers who are interested in taking them to their doctor appointments.
    * Medicines like radiation and chemo therapy can make it difficult or impossible to drive.  We all have busy lives, and sometimes you need assistance getting to and from the doctor.
    * Patients and Drivers alike can create user profiles.  Then, patients post their appointments, and drivers can volunteer for specific rides.  It's that simple!

## Tech stack ( you can include logos)
    *JavaScript
    *React
      -Bootstrap
        -SCSS
      -Router
    *Google Maps API
    *NodeJs
    *Express
      -Router
    *PostgreSQL

## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
Our main challenges were the scope of the project, limited time, and a small dev team.  We approached these challenges by setting aggressive-yet-realistic goals surrounding the most important application features.  We learned a tremendous amount including; the importance of git workflow, collaboration, separation of concerns, and schema design.  
  
## Challenges that were unexpected
We had a time-wide meeting in the beginning to decide on details like wireframes and schema design.  Despite the rigor with which we explored these subjects, there were several changes that happened during production.  This posed challenges because team members were in separate groups working on various pieces of the application, but needed to be wrangled together to realign and set clear expectations.  We learned that it's important to have regularly scheduled sprint meetings to brief one another on unexpected changes and progress made.
  
## Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app

    * What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)
  
## How does the app work?
When a user logs in, they will indicate whether or not they are a patient or a driver.  Upon clicking the submit button an event listener sets a chain of events into motion.

    * What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
    * OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
    * Optionally include a diagram
    * How does the tech stack come together?

## What research was required?
React Routers

Express Routers

SCSS

Google Maps API


## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.

    * Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
    * What did you learn from the process
    * What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
    * Writing tests
    * Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Any non-MVP tickets (optional)

 - Code refactorings
 - Performance Optimizations
 - Additional features
 - etc

## Notes from your Sprint Retro



## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?

    * Future refactoring?
    * Additional dev ops considerations?
    * UI/UX additions?
